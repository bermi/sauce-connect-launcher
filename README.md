[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/bermi/sauce-connect-launcher.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/bermi/sauce-connect-launcher)  [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/bermi/sauce-connect-launcher.svg)](https://david-dm.org/bermi/sauce-connect-launcher) [![](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/sauce-connect-launcher.svg) ![](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/sauce-connect-launcher.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sauce-connect-launcher)

A library to download and launch Sauce Connect.

## Installation

```sh
npm install sauce-connect-launcher
```

If you wish to also download Sauce Connect at this stage, rather than on first run, use the `SAUCE_CONNECT_DOWNLOAD_ON_INSTALL` environment variable.

```sh
SAUCE_CONNECT_DOWNLOAD_ON_INSTALL=true npm install
```

## Usage


### Simple Usage

```javascript
var sauceConnectLauncher = require('sauce-connect-launcher');

sauceConnectLauncher({
  username: 'bermi',
  accessKey: '12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab'
}, function (err, sauceConnectProcess) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Sauce Connect ready");

  sauceConnectProcess.close(function () {
    console.log("Closed Sauce Connect process");
  })
});
```

### Advanced Usage

```javascript

var sauceConnectLauncher = require('sauce-connect-launcher'),
  options = {

    // Sauce Labs username.  You can also pass this through the
    // SAUCE_USERNAME environment variable
    username: 'bermi',

    // Sauce Labs access key.  You can also pass this through the
    // SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY environment variable
    accessKey: '12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab',

    // Log output from the `sc` process to stdout?
    verbose: false,

    // Enable verbose debugging (optional)
    verboseDebugging: false,

    // Together with verbose debugging will output HTTP headers as well (optional)
    vv: false,

    // Port on which Sauce Connect's Selenium relay will listen for
    // requests. Default 4445. (optional)
    port: null,

    // Proxy host and port that Sauce Connect should use to connect to
    // the Sauce Labs cloud. e.g. "localhost:1234" (optional)
    proxy: null,

    // Change sauce connect logfile location (optional)
    logfile: null,

    // Period to log statistics about HTTP traffic in seconds (optional)
    logStats: null,

    // Maximum size before which the logfile is rotated (optional)
    maxLogsize: null,

    // Set to true to perform checks to detect possible misconfiguration or problems (optional)
    doctor: null,

    // Identity the tunnel for concurrent tunnels (optional)
    tunnelIdentifier: null,

    // an array or comma-separated list of regexes whose matches
    // will not go through the tunnel. (optional)
    fastFailRegexps: null,

    // an array or comma-separated list of domains that will not go
    // through the tunnel. (optional)
    directDomains: null,

    // A function to optionally write sauce-connect-launcher log messages.
    // e.g. `console.log`.  (optional)
    logger: function (message) {},

    // an optional suffix to be appended to the `readyFile` name.
    // useful when running multiple tunnels on the same machine,
    // such as in a continuous integration environment. (optional)
    readyFileId: null,

    // retry to establish a tunnel multiple times. (optional)
    connectRetries: 0

    // time to wait between connection retries in ms. (optional)
    connectRetryTimeout: 2000

    // retry to download the sauce connect archive multiple times. (optional)
    downloadRetries: 0

    // time to wait between download retries in ms. (optional)
    downloadRetryTimeout: 1000

    // path to a sauce connect executable (optional)
    // by default the latest sauce connect version is downloaded
    exe: null

    // keep sc running after the node process exited, this means you need to close
    // the process manually once you are done using the pidfile
    // Attention: This only works with sc versions <= 4.3.16 and only on macOS and
    // linux at the moment
    detached: null

    // specify a connect version instead of fetching the latest version, this currently
    // does not support checksum verification
    connectVersion: 'latest'
  };

sauceConnectLauncher(options, function (err, sauceConnectProcess) {
  console.log("Started Sauce Connect Process");
  sauceConnectProcess.close(function () {
    console.log("Closed Sauce Connect process");
  });
});

```

Additional Sauce Connect options not specified above can still be passed.  `additionalArg: "foo"` options will be converted to `--addtional-arg foo` args (camelCase to kebab-case). Additional option starting with dash `"-additionalArg": "foo"` will be passed as it is `-additionalArg foo`. Arrays will be `join()`ed (like `directDomains`) and boolean options will be passed as flags.  See [Sauce Connect's docs](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/) for a full list of arguments.

### Credentials

You can pass the Sauce Labs credentials as `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables. (reccommended)

You can also create a user.json file in your current working directory with the username and key

user.json
```
{"username": "bermi", "accessKey": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab"}
```

### Sauce Connect Version

You can override the default Sauce Connect version with the `SAUCE_CONNECT_VERSION` environment variable.

```sh
$ SAUCE_CONNECT_VERSION=4.2 node myTestApp.js
```


## Development

Clone the repository and run

```
make setup
```

You will be prompted for Sauce Labs credentials (used for testing).  Run
```
make dev
```
to start the watcher.


## Testing

```
npm test
```

or

```
make test
```
